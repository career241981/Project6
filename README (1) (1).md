# Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across multiple stores:

- Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to predict Pharmaceutical store(s) sales depending on factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores

## Task 01. Exploration of customer purchasing behavior:

- The EDA is done in 'Exploration_of_customer_purchasing_behaviour.ipynb' in notebook folder

## Task 2 - Prediction_of_store_sales:

- Data Preprocessing,
- Building models with sklearn pipelines,
- Choosing a loss function,
- Post Prediction analysis,
- Serialize models


  ## 2.6- deep_learning_model_with_deploye_model:
  
- Building model with deep learning, and 
- Using MLFlow to serve the prediction
